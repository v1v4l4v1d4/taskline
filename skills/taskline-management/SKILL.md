  Use whenever the user wants to track agent work as structured tasks
  inside a project — capturing a feature or bug, sequencing dependent
  work, picking the next thing to pull, advancing a task through the
  created → design → dev → review → done lifecycle, recording progress,
  or asking "what's left?". Trigger phrases include "create a task",
  "add a feature", "what should I work on next", "block this task on
  …", "mark X as in review / done", "show me the open bugs", and any
  project / kanban / backlog management ask. Use even when the user
  doesn't say "task" or "taskline" — phrases like "let's plan this",
  "queue this up", "track this", "what's runnable now" all qualify.
  Skip for one-off todo notes with no state, dependencies, or
  follow-up — just answer those directly.

# taskline — task management for AI agents

You drive a local **taskline** instance through the `taskline` CLI. It
tracks projects and the tasks (features / bugs) inside them, enforces a
five-state lifecycle (`created → design → dev → review → done`), models
inter-task dependencies as a DAG, and answers "what's runnable now?".
You are the client — server installation and lifecycle are not your
concern. Assume the server is already running on
`http://127.0.0.1:8787`; if a command fails with connection refused,
tell the user and stop, don't try to start anything.

The CLI is built for you, not a human at a terminal:

- JSON on stdout when not a TTY (your case). Pass `--format json` to
  force it; you almost never want `--format table`.
- Stable exit codes (0 success, non-zero error). Diagnostics on stderr.
- One subcommand per verb. No interactive prompts.

## When to use

Reach for taskline whenever the user's ask has *structure* — state,
ordering, dependencies, more than one item, "what's next?". Examples:

- "Track this as a feature in `<project>`"
- "What should I pick up next?"
- "Block `<task A>` on `<task B>`"
- "Mark `<id>` review / done"
- "Show me the open bugs / what's still in dev"
- "Wipe the done tasks from `<project>`"

Skip taskline when the user just wants a one-line note, a scratch
todo, or an answer that doesn't survive past this turn — reply
directly. taskline is the wrong tool for content that has no
follow-up.

## Environment

```bash
export TASKLINE_PROJECT="demo"   # default project so you can omit --project
```

`--project` overrides `$TASKLINE_PROJECT`. A project is referenced by
**name** (`demo`) or **id** (`9b…uuid`) — both work everywhere.
Export `TASKLINE_PROJECT` once at the start of a session that's
focused on a single project.

## Domain model

| Field         | Notes                                                                      |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`          | UUID, server-assigned                                                      |
| `project_id`  | UUID of owning project                                                     |
| `title`       | required, short                                                            |
| `description` | optional, longer prose                                                     |
| `type`        | `feature` (default) or `bug`                                               |
| `state`       | `created`, `design`, `dev`, `review`, `done`                               |
| `priority`    | integer; **higher = runs sooner** (default 0)                              |
| `depends_on`  | list of task ids; the task is blocked until **every** dep reaches `done`  |
| `images`      | optional binary attachments                                                |

**State machine.** Any state may transition to any other named state.
Forward jumps (`created` → `done`) and drop-backs (`review` → `dev`
when a defect surfaces) are both legal. The server only rejects
*unknown* state names with HTTP 400 — don't invent new ones.

**Runnable.** A task is runnable when its state is not `done` AND
every task it depends on has state `done`. The server sorts runnable
tasks by `priority DESC`, then `created_at ASC`. Use `taskline task
next` for the single highest-priority runnable task.

**Dependency DAG.** Adding an edge that would close a cycle is
rejected with HTTP 409. Self-deps are rejected. Re-adding an existing
edge is a no-op.

## CLI cheat sheet

`-h` on any subcommand prints flags. This is the full agent surface;
prefer these over hitting the HTTP API directly.

### Projects

```bash
taskline project create --name demo --description "first project"
taskline project list
```

### Tasks

```bash
# Create
taskline task create --project demo --title "first task" --type feature --priority 1

# List (filter by state with comma-separated names)
taskline task list --project demo
taskline task list --project demo --state created,dev

# Pick / inspect
taskline task next --project demo            # highest-priority runnable, or null
taskline task get <id>

# Mutate (PATCH semantics — only pass the flags you want changed)
taskline task update <id> --state review
taskline task update <id> --priority 5 --description "new prose"
taskline task delete <id>                    # cascades deps + images

# Dependencies
taskline task depend <id> --on <other-id>

# Image attachment (any binary)
taskline task upload <id> --file ./screenshot.png
```

Delete returns `{"deleted": true, "id": ...}`; depend returns
`{"task_id": ..., "depends_on": [...]}`. Pipe to `jq` freely.

## Stage playbook — "work the queue"

When the user says "work the queue" / "do the next task" / "keep
going through the backlog":

1. Run `taskline task next --project <p> --format json`.
2. If the response is `null`, report there's nothing runnable and stop.
3. Read `title`, `description`, and any `images` (when present, the
   server returns paths the user can open locally — surface them in
   your reply if they're material to the task).
4. Walk the task through the stages below in order. Each stage has the
   same shape: **Trigger** (what just happened) → **Actions** (do
   these now) → **Advance** (literal CLI command to move state) →
   **Skip when** (escape clause).
5. Loop back to step 1 — don't pause to ask the user whether to
   continue.

Higher-order capabilities (brainstorming, planning, code review) are
referenced by what they do, with a Superpowers skill name in
parentheses if your harness has them; drop the parenthetical if not
installed.

### created → design

- **Trigger:** you just picked the task off the queue.
- **Actions:**
  1. `git checkout main && git pull`
  2. `git checkout -b feature/<short-kebab-slug>` (slug from the title;
     keep it under ~30 chars).
  3. Confirm `git status` is clean.
- **Advance:** `taskline task update <id> --state design`
- **Skip when:** the change qualifies as fast-path (see below) — go
  straight to dev.

### design → dev

- **Trigger:** branch exists, title + description loaded.
- **Actions:**
  1. Brainstorm the approach — list 2-3 options, pick one. No human
     checkpoint. (capability: brainstorming —
     `superpowers:brainstorming`)
  2. Plan the work — break the chosen approach into ordered steps and
     name the test strategy. (capability: plan writing —
     `superpowers:writing-plans`)
  3. Capture the decision in a one-paragraph note (later commit body
     or scratch buffer) so dev has a contract.
- **Advance:** `taskline task update <id> --state dev`
- **Skip when:** the change is mechanical (rename, formatting,
  one-line config) — go straight to dev.

### dev → review

- **Trigger:** design note in hand.
- **Actions** (test-first):
  1. Write or extend failing tests for the new behavior.
  2. Implement until tests pass.
  3. Run the full project test suite for whatever you touched.
     For this repo: `( cd server && go test ./... )`,
     `( cd cli && go test ./... )`, `( cd web && pnpm build )`.
     Lint / format as the project requires.
  4. Stage and commit. Conventional, minimal messages.
- **Advance:** `taskline task update <id> --state review`
- **Skip when:** never. Tests are the gate.

### review → done

- **Trigger:** implementation committed on the feature branch.
- **Actions:**
  1. Self code-review for bugs, dead code, boundary issues.
     (capability: code review — `code-review:code-review`)
  2. Fix anything the review surfaces; re-run tests after each fix.
  3. `git push -u origin <branch>`.
  4. `gh pr create` with title, summary, and a test plan.
  5. **Wait for CI** if configured. If it fails, fix the root cause
     locally, re-run tests, push.
  6. **Wait for at least one review** — human or bot
     (`gemini-code-assist`, etc.). Don't merge before any review has
     posted; the whole point of opening a PR is the second pair of
     eyes. Poll with:

     ```bash
     gh pr view <n> --json reviews,reviewDecision,statusCheckRollup
     ```

     Re-check periodically until `reviews` is non-empty.
  7. Read **every** comment surface — one endpoint isn't enough:

     ```bash
     gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<n>/reviews     # bot summaries
     gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<n>/comments    # inline review comments
     gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<n>/comments   # top-level PR conversation
     ```

     Address each finding; re-run tests after each batch; push. If a
     comment is wrong, **reply with reasoning** rather than silently
     ignoring it.
- **Advance:** `taskline task update <id> --state done` *only after*
  (a) CI green or N/A, (b) at least one review posted, and
  (c) every reviewer comment addressed or rebutted.
- **Drop back to dev** with `taskline task update <id> --state dev`
  when review or CI surfaces a real defect. The bidirectional state
  machine exists for exactly this — don't delete-and-recreate.

### done — wrap-up

- **Trigger:** PR approved (or all comments addressed) + CI green.
- **Actions:**
  1. `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch` (or the project's style).
  2. `git checkout main && git pull`
  3. Delete the local feature branch (gh's `--delete-branch` may have
     done this already).
- The taskline task is already `done`; this stage is repo hygiene.

## Fast path

A task qualifies as fast-path when **all** of:

- single file changed,
- no behavior visible to other code,
- no test scaffolding or new dependency.

Examples: typo in a comment, raising a log level, bumping a constant.
The loop collapses to:

```
created → dev → done
```

No branch, no design note, no PR. Commit directly on main with a
one-line message. The state machine still records what happened.

## Gotchas

- **Forgot `--project`?** Export `TASKLINE_PROJECT` once at session
  start. Otherwise every task command needs the flag.
- **`server 400: invalid next state "..."`** — you used a name that
  isn't in `created/design/dev/review/done`. The state `test` was
  retired; don't reintroduce it.
- **`server 409: dependency would create a cycle`** — the edge would
  loop back. Restructure the graph or pick a different anchor.
- **`server 409: project name "X" already exists`** — name collision.
  Reuse the existing project (likely what you wanted) or pick a new
  name.
- **`error: project required`** — neither `--project` nor
  `$TASKLINE_PROJECT` is set.
- **`task next` returned `null`** — nothing runnable. Either the
  project is empty, or every non-done task is blocked. Run
  `taskline task list --project <p> --state created,design,dev,review`
  to see what's stuck and why.
- **The user said "remind me to X"** — that's a one-off note, not a
  task. Reply directly; don't create a taskline entry.
