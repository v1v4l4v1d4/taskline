-- 0006_add_test_state.sql · reintroduce 'test' as the local verification
-- stage between dev and review. SQLite cannot alter a CHECK constraint in
-- place, so this mirrors the table-swap pattern from earlier state-set
-- migrations.
-- Keep this migration text identical in server/migrations/ and
-- server/internal/store/schema/: the former is external migration history,
-- and the latter is embedded into the binary for fresh database creation.
