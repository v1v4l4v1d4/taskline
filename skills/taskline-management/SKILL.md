  Use whenever the user wants to track agent work as tasks — planning a
  feature, recording bugs, sequencing dependent work, picking the next
  thing to do, or asking "what's left on this project?". The skill drives
  the `taskline` CLI which talks to a local taskline-server (HTTP, SQLite).
  Trigger phrases include "create a task", "add a feature", "what should
  I work on next", "block this task on …", "mark X done", "show me the
  open bugs", or any project / kanban management ask routed at the agent.

# taskline — task management for AI agents

You are the operator of a local **taskline** instance: a small HTTP server
backed by SQLite, fronted by a CLI named `taskline`. taskline tracks
projects and the tasks (features / bugs) inside them, supports an explicit
state machine (`created → design → dev → review → done`), models
inter-task dependencies as a DAG, and exposes a "what's runnable now"
query that respects priority and blocked-on relationships.

The tool is designed to be driven by you, not by a human in a UI. Output
is JSON-first when stdout is not a TTY. Stable exit codes (0 success,
non-zero error). Diagnostics go to stderr.

## When to use this skill

Invoke any time the user touches task state:

- "Track this as a feature in <project>"
- "What's the next task I should pick up?"
- "Block <task A> on <task B>"
- "Mark <task X> as in review"
- "Show me what's still open"
- "Wipe the done tasks from <project>"

If the user only wants a one-off note or todo line, this is the wrong
tool — just reply directly. taskline is for work that has structure
(state, dependencies, multiple items, priority).

## Standard environment knobs

Set these once per shell so you don't have to repeat `--project`:

```bash
export TASKLINE_SERVER="http://127.0.0.1:8787"   # default base URL
export TASKLINE_PROJECT="demo"                   # default project for task subcommands
```

The `--project` flag overrides `$TASKLINE_PROJECT`. Anything that
references a project accepts either the **name** (`demo`) or the **id**
(`9b...uuid`).

## Domain model

### Project

A workspace that owns tasks. Names are unique. Has an optional
description.

### Task

| Field        | Notes                                                                |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`         | UUID, server-assigned                                                |
| `project_id` | UUID of owning project                                               |
| `title`      | required, short                                                      |
| `description`| optional, longer prose                                               |
| `type`       | `feature` (default) or `bug`                                         |
| `state`      | `created` → `design` → `dev` → `review` → `done`                     |
| `priority`   | integer, **higher = runs sooner** (default 0)                        |
| `depends_on` | list of task ids (the task is blocked until each dep reaches `done`) |
| `images`     | optional binary attachments per task                                 |

### State machine

State moves between any of the five known names. Forward jumps (e.g.
`created` → `done`) and drop-backs (`review` → `dev` when a defect
surfaces) are both accepted. The server only rejects unknown state
names with HTTP 400.

### Runnable

A task is *runnable* when (a) its state is not `done`, and (b) every
task it depends on **is** in state `done`. The server returns runnable
tasks sorted by `priority DESC` then `created_at ASC` — call
`taskline task next` for the single highest-priority runnable task.

### Dependency DAG

Adding a dependency that would close a cycle is rejected with HTTP 409.
A task may not depend on itself. Re-adding an existing edge is a no-op.

## CLI cheat sheet

`-h` on any subcommand prints flags. The shapes below are the AI-facing
contract; the CLI is intentionally narrow.

### Projects

```bash
taskline project create --name demo --description "first project"
taskline project list
```

### Tasks

```bash
# Create
taskline task create --project demo --title "first task" --type feature --priority 1

# List
taskline task list --project demo                       # all
taskline task list --project demo --state created,dev   # filter

# Inspect / pick the next runnable task
taskline task get <id>
taskline task next --project demo

# Mutate
taskline task update <id> --state review
taskline task update <id> --priority 5 --description "new prose"
taskline task delete <id>

# Dependencies
taskline task depend <id> --on <other-id>

# Image attachment (any binary, not strictly an image)
taskline task upload <id> --file ./screenshot.png
```

### Output formatting

- Default: **JSON** when stdout is not a TTY (your case as an agent),
  **table** when run by a human.
- Force with `--format json` or `--format table`.
- All structured commands return JSON objects with stable shapes; the
  delete + dependency commands return `{"deleted": true, "id": ...}` /
  `{"task_id": ..., "depends_on": ...}` so you can pipe into `jq`.

## Stage playbook

When asked to "work the queue":

1. `taskline task next --project <p> --format json` — get a single task.
2. If `task` is `null`, report there's nothing runnable and stop.
3. Read `title` + `description` (and `images` if present — server
   stores them under `$TASKLINE_IMAGES_DIR/<task-id>/`).
4. Walk the task through the stages below. Each stage describes the
   actions, the literal command to advance, and when the stage may be
   skipped.
5. Loop back to step 1.

Each stage has the same shape: **Trigger** (what just happened) →
**Actions** → **Advance** (literal CLI command) → **Skip when**
(escape clause). Higher-order skills are referenced by capability,
with a Superpowers skill name in parentheses for harnesses that have
them — drop the parenthetical if the skill isn't installed.

### created → design

- **Trigger:** the agent has just claimed the task.
- **Actions:**
  1. `git checkout main && git pull`
  2. `git checkout -b feature/<short-slug>` (slug derived from the
     task title — keep it short, kebab-case).
  3. Confirm the working tree is clean.
- **Advance:** `taskline task update <id> --state design`
- **Skip when:** the change qualifies as fast-path (see below).

### design → dev

- **Trigger:** branch exists, task title + description are loaded.
- **Actions:**
  1. Brainstorm the approach — explore intent, list 2-3 options, pick
     one. Auto-mode (no human checkpoint).
     Capability: brainstorming (e.g. `superpowers:brainstorming` if
     available).
  2. Plan the work — break the chosen approach into ordered steps and
     identify the test strategy.
     Capability: plan writing (e.g. `superpowers:writing-plans` if
     available).
  3. Capture the decision in a short note (commit body or one-paragraph
     spec) so the dev phase has a contract.
- **Advance:** `taskline task update <id> --state dev`
- **Skip when:** the change is mechanical (rename, formatting,
  single-line config) — go straight to dev.

### dev → review

- **Trigger:** design note in hand.
- **Actions** (test-first):
  1. Write or extend failing tests for the new behavior.
  2. Implement until the tests pass.
  3. Run the full project test suite for whatever you touched
     (e.g. `( cd server && go test ./... )`, `( cd cli && go test ./... )`,
     `( cd web && pnpm build )`). Lint/format as the project requires.
  4. Stage and commit. Conventional, minimal commit messages.
- **Advance:** `taskline task update <id> --state review`
- **Skip when:** never. Tests are the gate, not the ceremony.

### review → done

- **Trigger:** implementation committed on the feature branch.
- **Actions:**
  1. Self code-review — spot bugs, dead code, boundary issues.
     Capability: code review (e.g. `code-review:code-review` if
     available).
  2. Fix anything the review surfaces; re-run tests after each fix.
  3. Push the branch: `git push -u origin <branch>`.
  4. Open a PR: `gh pr create` with title, summary, and a test plan.
  5. Wait for CI. If it fails, fix the root cause locally, re-run
     tests, push.
  6. **Wait for at least one review** — human or automated bot like
     `gemini-code-assist`. Don't merge before a review has actually
     posted; the whole point of opening a PR is the second pair of
     eyes. Poll with:

     ```
     gh pr view <n> --json reviews,reviewDecision
     ```

     Re-check periodically (or use webhooks if available) until
     `reviews` is non-empty or a human signs off.
  7. Read **every** comment surface — one endpoint isn't enough:

     ```
     # Review summaries (the "## Code Review" body from bots etc.):
     gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<n>/reviews
     # Inline review comments (line-anchored):
     gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<n>/comments
     # Top-level PR conversation:
     gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<n>/comments
     ```

     Address each finding; re-run tests after each batch of fixes;
     push. If a comment is wrong, reply with reasoning rather than
     silently ignoring it.
- **Advance:** `taskline task update <id> --state done` *only after*
  (a) CI is green, (b) at least one review has posted, and
  (c) every reviewer comment has been addressed or rebutted.
- **Drop back to dev** with `taskline task update <id> --state dev`
  when the review or CI surfaces a real defect. The bidirectional
  state machine exists for exactly this — don't delete-and-recreate.

### done — wrap-up

- **Trigger:** PR approved (or all review comments addressed) + CI green.
- **Actions:**
  1. `gh pr merge --squash` (or the project's conventional style).
  2. `git checkout main && git pull`
  3. Delete the local feature branch.
- The taskline task is already `done`; this stage is repo hygiene.

## Fast path

A task qualifies as fast-path when **all** of:

- single file changed,
- no behavior change visible to other code,
- no test scaffolding or new dependency.

Examples: typo fix in a comment, raising a log level, bumping a
constant. The loop collapses to:

```
created → dev → done
```

No branch, no design note, no PR. Commit directly on main with a
one-line message. The state machine still records what happened.

## Failure modes you will see

| Symptom                                                  | Cause / fix                                                                                              |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `server 404: project ... does not exist`                 | typo'd `--project`; run `taskline project list` to confirm                                               |
| `server 400: invalid next state "..."`                   | unrecognized state name (e.g. `test` was retired) — pick one of `created/design/dev/review/done`         |
| `server 409: dependency would create a cycle`            | the dep edge would loop back; restructure or pick a different anchor task                                |
| `server 409: project name "X" already exists`            | name collision; pick a different name or reuse the existing project (it's likely what you want)          |
| `error: project required (--project or $TASKLINE_PROJECT)` | export `TASKLINE_PROJECT` once at session start to avoid repeating the flag                              |

## What this skill is not

- Not a UI-driven kanban. There is no board view; the model is the
  truth, queries are programmatic.
- Not a multi-tenant SaaS. SQLite, single-user, runs on your machine.
- Not a project planner. taskline tracks **what to do next**, not
  spec authoring or dependency derivation. You bring the structure.
- Not a CI / orchestration runner. State changes are purely
  declarative — taskline does not invoke the work, you do.
