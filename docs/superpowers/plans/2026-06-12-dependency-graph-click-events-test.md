# Dependency Graph Click Events Test Report

Task: `78d47b4c-102d-413e-b937-26969742021d`

## Summary

All checks passed. The only warning observed was Vite's existing large chunk
warning during production builds.

## Automated Checks

- Focused red test:
  `mise exec -- pnpm --dir web test src/components/GraphView.test.tsx` failed
  before implementation because double-click still opened the editor and
  single-click still selected the graph node.
- Focused green test:
  `mise exec -- pnpm --dir web test src/components/GraphView.test.tsx` passed
  with `8` tests.
- Frontend lint:
  `mise exec -- pnpm --dir web lint` passed.
- Frontend test:
  `mise exec -- pnpm --dir web test` passed with `7` files and `65` tests.
- Frontend build:
  `mise exec -- pnpm --dir web build` passed.

## Running Binary Smoke

- Rebuilt and restarted the embedded server with
  `mise exec -- ./scripts/start-local.sh`.
- Created browser smoke project `graph-click-smoke-1781199568693` on the
  running server.
- Opened `http://127.0.0.1:8787/?project=graph-click-smoke-1781199568693` in
  headless Chrome via CDP and switched to the Dependency graph tab.
- Browser interaction checks passed:
  - single-clicking `Editable graph task` opened its editor;
  - after single-click, `Editable graph task` was not selected;
  - after single-click, `Unrelated graph task` was not dimmed;
  - double-clicking `Editable graph task` did not open the editor;
  - after double-click, `Editable graph task` was selected;
  - after double-click, dependency and child nodes stayed undimmed;
  - after double-click, `Unrelated graph task` was dimmed.

## Result

The implementation is ready for review.
